# Isaac Run Logger

This WIP mod provides a dashboard overview of your Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth runs. It displays all items the player has when a run is won / lost. Modded items are displayed as well.

To install, simply put this in your Binding of Isaac Mod directory. By default, this is "C:\\Users\\**{username}**\\Documents\\My games\\Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ Mods".

To start the log, just run ```startDashboard.bat``` or run ```node main``` in a command prompt in the run_logger directory. Go to `http://localhost` and track your runs!
